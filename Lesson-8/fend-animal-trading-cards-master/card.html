			<p>ZSL's conservation work with Asian elephants
Asian elephants are classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and due to habitat loss, human conflict and poaching their wild populations are in decline.

The species are also listed on ZSLâ€™s EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) list, meaning there is a particularly urgent need for conservation action.

As part of its global conservation efforts, ZSL is currently working in Thailand, a major stronghold for Asian elephants, to reduce human-wildlife conflict and ensure the peaceful coexistence of elephants and humans.</p>
